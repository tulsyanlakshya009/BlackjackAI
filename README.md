## ✨ Features

- **Blackjack Simulator**: Implements standard rules, persistent multi-deck shoe with automatic reshuffle.
- **Q-Learning Agent**: Learns hit/stand policy using ε-greedy exploration and dynamic ε-decay.
- **Dynamic Bet-Sizing**: Maps card-count probabilities (low/mid/high) to bets (10–100) via a damped linear ramp.
- **Baseline Rule-Based Agent**: Simple strategy for benchmarking.
- **Tkinter GUI**: Play interactively, see AI's suggested action and bet in real time.

## 🏃 Usage

### Training & Testing the AI

AI is trained over 500,000 hands and tested on 100,000 hands:
```bash
python train_blackjack_ai.py
```

### Running the GUI

Launch the interactive GUI:
```bash
python blackjackgui.py
```
- Use the radio buttons to switch between **AI** and **Baseline**.
- Enter a bet and click **Bet** to start.
- The AI panel displays suggested bet, action, and deck composition percentages.

## 🧠 Algorithms

### MDP Formulation

- **State**: `(player_total, dealer_up, low_prob, mid_prob, high_prob, bet)`
- **Actions**: `hit` or `stand`
- **Reward**: +1.5×bet on win, 0 on draw, –1×bet on loss

### Q-Learning Agent

- Tabular Q-learning with update:
  \(Q(s,a) <- Q(s,a) + α [r + γ max_{a'} Q(s',a') – Q(s,a)]\)
- α = 0.05, γ = 0.95
- ε-greedy exploration: ε decays from 1.0 -> 0.05

### Bet-Sizing Heuristic

1. Compute `low`, `mid`, `high` probabilities from deck
2. Raw advantage: `adv_raw = high – low`
3. Damped: `adv_adj = adv_raw × (1 – mid)` to account for neutral 7–9’s
4. Normalize to [0,1], then linearly scale to [10,100]
5. Round to nearest multiple of 10

### Baseline Agent

- Fixed bet = 10
- Hit if `player_total <= 16`, stand if >= 17
